# WellnessBot

## Description
Given the rise in the awareness of mental health and the importance of self-care since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a website that is interactive, user-friendly, sleek, purposeful and useful. With WellnessBot users can document, track, and receive support on your wellness journey all in one place!

## Installation

Our group used bcryptjs, dotenv, express, nodemon, openai, sequelize, and handlebars.

## Usage

The website header is displayed across the top of the home page in a gradient bar, and it includes the website's name accompanied by a robot emoji. Just below, two forms are displayed side-by-side. The form on the left is the login form for users that have already created accounts to log in. The heading 'Login' is displayed in the inside upper left hand corner of the box that contains the login form. Below the heading, two text input fields are displayed vertically where users are required to type in login credentials. Above the first input field their is the headging "E-mail" address, while the heading "Password" is displayed above the second input field their passord. Just below the password field there is a a 'Submit' button for users to submit their login credentials and login to their accounts. 
The form on the left is a signup form for new users to create accounts. There are five text input fields displayed vertically just below the heading "Signup," labeled "First Name," "Last Name," "E-Mail," "Password," and "Confirm Password," for new users to create their accounts. Below the "Confirm Password" text input field new users click a "Signup" button to create their accounts and log in. Once new users have created an account successfully, they will see a modal notifying them of a successful account creation, and they are prompted to log in using using the login form.

Once users are logged in to their account, the same gradient colored header is displayed accross the top, and it includes the site's name just like on the home page along with the "Logout" bottom located on the far right. Below the header, there are two boxes displayed horizontally. 

The left box takes up about 1/3 of the page. It has the heading, "Wellness History." Here, users will be able to see and have access to prior conversations/sessions with the WellnessBot. Each previous session will be hyperlinked for users to be able to visit the previous selected session. When a previous session link is selected, the previous session information will be displayed on the same page below the box on the right.

The box to the right takes up approximately 2/3 of the page. It has the heading, "Wellness Session," and just below the heading there is the prompt, "Let Wellnessbot know how you're feeling to receive support!" Just below the prompt, users are presented with a text input field with placeholder text, "How are you feeling today?" This is where they let WellnessBot know how they are feeling, then they would click on the "Log" button just to the right of the text input box. WellnessBot's response/support appears just below the text input field.
